## Issue description

Commonly used security scanners can still see CVEs even if they are patched by KernelCare. It turns out that all their decisions about CVE are based on:

* currently installed (or not) kernel packages
* uname information

## How to use

Itâ€™s rather simple. New scan results after installing a package and applying a patchset should not show any kernel CVEs that are handled by KernelCare.

For example, Nessus for an old kernel shows a bunch of detected CVEs

After patches were applied, there are no kernel-related CVEs
