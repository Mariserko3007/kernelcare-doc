### Link Via Add-on. Optional License


In order to allow your client to decide whether he wants to order server with or without a license we will use Product Add-on. In this way, when the client orders an add-on, the relation will be triggered and the license product will be ordered along with module.

The following steps must be performed to prepare such connection:

Go to _Setup → Products/Services → Products Add-ons_ and click _Add New Add-on_ .
Fill add-on name, set up billing cycle and price.
Then tick _Show on Order_ checkbox, assign add-on to the product and click _Save Changes_ .

### Link Via Configurable Options


In order to allow your client  to decide whether he wants to order server with or without license we can use Configurable Options ( [https://docs.whmcs.com/Addons_and_Configurable_Options](https://docs.whmcs.com/Addons_and_Configurable_Options) ).

Below we will show you what steps to proceed to prepare such connection:
Configure CloudLinuxLicenses product as described [here](/configuration_of_product/) .
Go to _Setup → Products/Services → Configurable Options_ and click _Create a New Group_ .
Fill group name and add _New Configurable Option_ , set up billing cycle, price and option type. Then save changes.
Go to _Add-ons → CloudLinux Licenses Add-on → Configurable Options Relations_ and click _Add Relation_ .
Choose appropriate configurable option and license product which it is assigned to and click _Add relation_ .

**_Note. The plugin doesn’t support “quantity” type of Configurable Options._**

### Link Add-ons Directly


_[for WHMCS 7.2.x and later]_

WHMCS 7.2 introduces the ability to associate Product Add-ons with Provisioning Modules.

Go to _Setup → Products/Services → Products Add-ons_ and click _Add New Add-on_ .
Fill add-on name, set up billing cycle and price. Then tick _Show on Order_ checkbox, assign add-on to the product.
Go to _Module Settings_ tab and select _CloudLinux Licenses_ from _Module Name_ drop-down.
Fill _Username_ and _Password_ with your CloudLinux API access (API secret key) details and select **_KernelCare_** from _License Type_ drop-down.
Click _Save Changes_ to confirm.

Only change IP address feature has to be ordered manually.

You can also view the details of created license.

## Common Problems


After activating the server provisioning product, license provisioning product bounded to it is still pending.
**Reason** : License IP address may be already taken.
**Solution** : Change server IP address.

**_Note_** _. Currently, only key-based licenses are available for Imunify360. Support of IP-based licenses will be added soon._
