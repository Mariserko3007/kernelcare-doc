# Kcare-nexpose


The script marks vulnerabilities detected by Nexpose, but patched by KernelCare as exceptions.

## Installation


### From yum repository



To install kcare-nexpose, start with the minimal image of EL6:

```
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/kcare-eportal.repo <<EOL
```
```
[kcare-eportal]
```
```
name=kcare-eportal
```
```
baseurl=http://repo.eportal.kernelcare.com/x86_64/
```
```
gpgkey=http://repo.cloudlinux.com/kernelcare-debian/6/conf/kcaredsa_pub.gpg
```
```
enabled=1
```
```
gpgcheck=1
```
```
EOL
```

To install kcare-nexpose run the command:

```
$ yum install kcare-nexpose
```

 
### From github


 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudlinux/kcare-nexpose.git
```
```
$ cd kcare-nexpose/
```
```
$ python setup.py install
```
```
$ pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
```

## How It Works


The script finds CVEs that are related to patches applied by KernelCare (downloaded either from KernelCare ePortal or the central KernelCare patch server) and excludes them from Nexpose vulnerability scanner reports. The script can approve this exception in Nexpose (if you do not want to approve, set `is_approve` to `false` in the script config). It can also remove the old exceptions left from the previous script runs (set `delete_old` to `true` in the script config).

First, you should generate report in Nexpose (see supported report types below) and specify it in the config file. Also you need to specify some other [parameters](/yaml_config_file_description/) :

```
$ cp /usr/local/etc/kcare-nexpose.yml.template /usr/local/etc/kcare-nexpose.yml
$ vim /usr/local/etc/kcare-nexpose.yml
```

**Note.** _ IP address in Nexpose and the one in _ _KernelCare_ _ ePortal should be the same. If you use Nexpose and _ _KernelCare_ _ ePortal on different instances, you should make sure that Nexpose and _ _KernelCare_ _ ePortal are not using localhost (127.0.0.1). Otherwise, kcare-nexpose can mark vulnerability wrong, as it just analyzes IP addresses from Nexpose and _ _KernelCare_ _ ePortal._
_If used with CLN license server, the script can work with servers behind NAT by matching them by their hostnames._
