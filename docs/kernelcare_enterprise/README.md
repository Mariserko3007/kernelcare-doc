## Managing Users


You can manage portal using /usr/bin/kc.eportal utility:

```
-l | --list-users      : list all users
```
```
-a | --add-user        : add a user
```
```
-d | --delete-user     : delete a user
```
```
-c | --change-password : change a user password
```

```

To add a user:

```
$ kc.eportal -a admin -p AdminPassword
```

To change user's password:

```
$ kc.eportal -c admin -p NewPassword
```

### LDAP authorization


 
It is possible to support a secure connection. To do so, specify the right format of connection string as a key to enter user login.

For example:

`uid=%s,dc=example,dc=com`

**Note.** This key is a must in a connection string and should include ‘%s’

You are also able to specify security settings and set-up timeouts using LDAP URL.


## Accessing ePortal


To access KernelCare.eportal management console, connect to:
[http://YOUR_IP/admin](http://YOUR_IP/admin)

And enter your login & password

You can manage your login information using [kc.eportal tool](/managing_users/) .

## PatchSet Deployment


[ePortal v0.8+]

KernelCare.ePortal has built-in mechanism to download latest patches. To start using it, click on ‘Patch Source’ link in KernelCare.ePortal navigational bar. Your patch source access info will be provided by your KernelCare representative.

![](/images/eportal_dep01.jpg)

Once you set up patch source access info, you will get to a list of available patchsets. You can always go back & change your access info by clicking on ‘Source’ link.

![](/images/eportal_dep02_zoom87.png)
Clicking on [changelog] will provide changelog for given patchset.
Clicking on [deploy this patch, and all before it] will download and deploy this patchset and all the patchsets above. It is impossible to deploy patchsets out of order.




## Managing Keys


To register new servers you need to create a KernelCare key used for the registration.
Click _Add_ button, so a new registration key will be automatically generated and shown in the list below.


![](/images/hmfile_hash_13c22427.png)
The key itself will be used as part of the registration command on individual server. You can provide a description for the key, as well as max servers that can be registered under that key.
Removing the key would remove all servers under the key.

Clicking on the key would let you see the information about [servers registered](/managing_servers/) under that key, as well as remove servers.


## Managing Servers


You can see servers belonging to the key by clicking on the key itself in [Managing Keys](/managing_keys/) interface.

![](/images/server_list.png)
The screen shows servers registered under the key, their IP, hostname, effective kernel as well as the time of registration and last check in.

### Managing Script



**_Note._** If scripts do not work on your ePortal, you might need to update ePortal first. To update ePortal, please run the following command:

```
> yum update kcare-eportal
```

To view the list of all servers IDs that are connected to the particular key, do the following:
In the UI go to the page with the list of keys. Then click the particular key. The list of servers connected to this key will be displayed.

To view the list of all servers IDs that are not connected to any key, do the following:
In the UI go to the page with the list of keys. Then click _Reset filters_ button.
OR just follow this URL _http://EPORTAL_IP/admin/kcserver/._


### Script to unroll patchsets


 
To unroll patchset run:

```
> kc.eportal --unroll 16012017_1
```

### Script to determine the number of servers under the management of ePortal, per key



To see pairs of key/number of servers run:

```
> kc.eportal --list-servers
```

`Count | Key`
`----- + --------------------------------`
`   0 | 2shcolu7Y1x6885Q`
`   2 | 6J89aS44j6OmTr05`


### Script to automatically install latest patchsets



It determines if latest patches are available and installs them.

```
>kc.eportal --get-latest
```

### Unroll patches from UI


 
In the patch-source page, there is a list of available patches. To unroll patches click the button _ Roll back this patch, and all after it._
Use it to roll back the patch and all the following patches.

### Show extended check-in statistics in admin UI



A new table is added to the starting page. This table displays the following:
Total number of servers.
Number of servers that checked in for the past 48 hours.

The number of servers for each key is listed in the _Key Inventory_ table.

### Ability to create read-only users


 
`[root@localhost ~]# kc.eportal -l`
`Num | Username`
`--- + --------------------------------`
`  1 | admin`
`  2 | user`
`[root@localhost ~]# kc.eportal -r user`
`User 'user' is now readonly`

### Feed Management



Feeds are intended to manage patchsets on the server, and they provide a possibility to bind a set of patches to a specific key. Possible use cases: for preliminary testing of patches, for applying updates to groups of servers with the similar hardware, etc.

To get into Feeds Management interface go to Settings → Feeds:

![](/images/feedmanagement1_zoom70.png)

On this page a user can manage the existing feeds: create, delete, edit.

![](/images/feedmanagement2_zoom70.png)

Available options:
Name — a name of a feed.
Auto update — enable and disable automatic downloading of patches to this feed.
Deploy after X hours — a delay in hours between the moment the patchset is available for deployment and the moment it is installed to the feed.

Every 10 minutes ePortal checks for new patches on the main patch server. If a new patch is available, it is uploaded to the ePortal server. Note: it is uploaded but is not deployed. The patch availability time is considered starting from the moment a new patch appears on the ePortal, and that time is taken into account in _Deploy after X hours _ option _._ So, if a user sets _ Deploy after X hours = 10_ , the patch will be deployed to the feed 10 hours after it has been downloaded to the ePortal server.

To make the feed auto-update immediately (so that, new patches are loaded to the feed immediately after they are available on ePortal), set _Deploy after X hours = 0._

A special case is a clean installation when ePortal is installed on a new server (there aren't any downloaded archives with patches and feeds with deployed patchsets, including default feed). In this case, if a user creates a new feed and sets Deployed after X hours option right away, then all patches (from the oldest to the latest available) will be deployed to the feed after the specified X hours. This is because the archives are downloaded from scratch and will be considered as “just appeared on ePortal” — that is, all patches will have the same appearance time on ePortal from which the option Deploy after X hours will repel.

![](/images/feedmanagement3_zoom70.png)

On the main ePortal page, a user can set the corresponding key <> feed pair. This is done in the key creation interface or when editing a key.

![](/images/feedmanagement4_zoom70.png)

By default, a new key is bound to the default feed, alternatively, a user can choose a desired feed from the drop-down menu.

![](/images/feedmanagement5_zoom70.png)

Note that when removing a feed all keys attached to this feed will be moved to the default feed.

![](/images/feedmanagement6_zoom70.png)

### Adding extra Tag field


 
To add an extra Tag field for the server, run:

```
kcarectl --tag command
```

where _command_ is a parameter defined by a user. This parameter will be displayed in UI for the server. User could add multiple tags for each server. Each tag should be separated with ‘;’ symbol.

Example:

```
kcarectl --tag “env:prod;ubuntu”
```

This server has two tags : _env:prod_ and _ubuntu_ .

_env:prod_ is a parameter that has tag name _env_ and the value _prod._

![](/images/addingextratagfield_zoom88.png)

To remove all tags from a particular server, run:

```
kcarectl --tag ""
```

Where ''" is a parameter to delete the previously defined tag.


### How to setup ePortal to use HTTPS



Some assumptions for a server where e-portal is deployed:

1. A firewall is disabled for 443 port.
2. Private and public keys are downloaded on the server.

Edit ssl configuration template according to your certificates:

```
mv /etc/nginx/eportal.ssl.conf.example /etc/nginx/eportal.ssl.conf
vi /etc/nginx/eportal.ssl.conf
```

Include this configuration into the main one:

```
sed -e '3iinclude eportal.ssl.conf;' -i /etc/nginx/conf.d/eportal.conf
```

Restart nginx:

```
service nginx restart
```

In order to communicate with e-portal, updated to https, you need to modify KernelCare config files on all the servers if they have IPs hardcoded servers settings.

To do that, update PATCH_SERVER and REGISTRATION_URL environment variables:

```
vi /etc/sysconfig/kcare/kcare.conf
```

So, after editing your _/etc/sysconfig/kcare/kcare.conf_ should contain updated PATCH_SERVER and REGISTRATION_URL environment variables like in the example below:

```
PATCH_SERVER=https://eportal_domain_name/
REGISTRATION_URL=https://eportal_domain_name/admin/api/kcare
```

The following example demonstrates how to connect new servers to e-portal configured for https:

```
$ export KCARE_PATCH_SERVER=https://eportal_domain_name/
$ export KCARE_REGISTRATION_URL=https://eportal_domain_name/admin/api/kcare
$ export KCARE_MAILTO=admin@mycompany.com
$ curl -s https://repo.cloudlinux.com/kernelcare/kernelcare_install.sh | bash
$ /usr/bin/kcarectl --register key_from_your_eportal
```

## Deploying kernelcare


To deploy kernelcare client software to use ePortal, following enviornment variables should be setup prior to RPM install:

| |  | |
|-|--|-|
|**Environment Variable** | **Value** | **Description**|
|KCARE_PATCH_SERVER | http://eportal_ip/ | URL to a server from which patches will be downloaded|
|KCARE_REGISTRATION_URL | http://eportal_ip/admin/api/kcare | URL to ePortal's api|
|KCARE_MAILTO [2.5+] | email@address | Email to receive all notifications related to failed KernelCare updates. Used in /etc/cron.d/kcare-cron|

Example:

```
$ export KCARE_PATCH_SERVER=http://10.1.10.115/
$ export KCARE_REGISTRATION_URL=http://10.1.10.115/admin/api/kcare
```
```
$ export 
$ curl -s https://repo.cloudlinux.com/kernelcare/kernelcare_install.sh | bash
$ kcarectl --register r72fF838Q47oWigj
```

## KernelCare client config file


KernelCare client configuration file is located in /etc/sysconfig/kcare/kcare.conf

Example:

```
AUTO_UPDATE=True
PATCH_SERVER=http://10.1.10.115/
REGISTRATION_URL=http://10.1.10.115/admin/api/kcare
```

`If AUTO_UPDATE set to true, KernelCare client will check in every 4 hours, and try to download and apply latest patches`
`PATCH_SERVER -- server from which patches will be downloaded`
`REGISTRATION_URL -- URL used to register/unregister server`


## Changing ePortal IP


You can change ePortal IP at any moment, but you need to modify KernelCare config files on all the servers if they have IPs hardcoded.
To do that, edit: /etc/sysconfig/kcare/kcare.conf

Change:

```
PATCH_SERVER=http://10.1.10.115/
REGISTRATION_URL=http://10.1.10.115/admin/api/kcare
```

To point to the right location.


## Configuration & locations


Web Server (nginx) configuration is located at /etc/nginx/conf.d/eportal.conf

Database (sqlite) is stored in /usr/share/kcare-eportal/data.sqlite
To reset database:

```
$ rm /usr/share/kcare-eportal/data.sqlite
$ cd /usr/share/kcare-eportal && python createdb.py
```

Client access data file used to decide if server has access to the patches is stored in /usr/share/kcare-eportal/kcare_servers.htpasswd

Patches are stored in: /usr/share/kcare-eportal/patches

## ePortal API


[version 0.9+]

KernelCare.ePortal provides limited API to remove servers based on key & IP.

To access the API, first setup API token used for authentication:

`echo your_token > /usr/share/kcare-eportal/config/api.token`

API method: `unregister_by_key.plain`

Parameters:

key - KernelCare.ePortal key under which server is registered;
IP - remote server IP as displayed in KernelCare.ePortal;
token - API token.

Example:

[https://ePortal_url/admin/api/kcare/unregister_by_key.plain?key=2M6gmIS6fHh39aF2&ip=10.1.10.74&token=your_token](https://ePortal_url/admin/api/kcare/unregister_by_key.plain?key=2M6gmIS6fHh39aF2&ip=10.1.10.74&token=your_token)

Return code: int
-3 API token file does not exist;
-2 API token doesn't match;
-1 Internal error, see /var/log/uwsgi/uwsgi-emperor.log for details;
any other number - number of servers removed.

## Nagios & Zabbix support


KernelCare.ePortal since version 1.2 supports server monitoring similar to [Nagios](/nagios_plugin/) & [Zabbix](/zabbix_template/) monitoring.

You can curl the API directly to receive the information:

[https://yourserver/admin/api/kcare/nagios/KCAREKEY](https://yourserver/admin/api/kcare/nagios/KCAREKEY)

or you can use [http://patches.kernelcare.com/downloads/nagios/check_kcare](http://patches.kernelcare.com/downloads/nagios/check_kcare) script by modifying KEY_KCARE_NAGIOS_ENDPOINT in it to point to your server (change [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/clweb](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/clweb) (link to old UI) or [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login) (link to new UI) with [https://yourserver/admin](https://yourserver/admin) ).

* Please, note that access using PARTNER_LOGIN/TOKEN is not supported by KernelCare.ePortal.
